To help you, use these optimized versions of the common SQL query mistakes with examples:

1. **Using SELECT *:**
   - Mistake: `SELECT * FROM employees;`
   - Optimized: Instead of selecting all columns, specify the required columns:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;
     ```

2. **Not using proper indexing:**
   - Mistake: Not creating an index on the frequently queried column.
   - Optimized: Create an index on the `customer_id` column:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
     ```

3. **Not using proper JOIN syntax:**
   - Mistake: Implicit join.
   - Optimized: Use explicit JOIN syntax:
     ```sql
     SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name
     FROM orders
     INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
     ```

4. **Using DISTINCT unnecessarily:**
   - Mistake: `SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;`
   - Optimized: Review if duplicate values are necessary, and if not, remove DISTINCT:
     ```sql
     SELECT department FROM employees;
     ```

5. **Using COUNT(*) inefficiently:**
   - Mistake: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;`
   - Optimized: If only the count is required, use `COUNT(1)`:
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(1) FROM orders;
     ```

6. **Not utilizing WHERE clause efficiently:**
   - Mistake: Not filtering rows early in the query.
   - Optimized: Place filtering conditions in the WHERE clause:
     ```sql
     SELECT product_name, unit_price FROM products WHERE category_id = 1;
     ```

7. **Using string functions in WHERE clause:**
   - Mistake: `WHERE SUBSTRING(product_name, 1, 3) = 'ABC';`
   - Optimized: Precompute values or use indexed columns:
     ```sql
     WHERE product_name LIKE 'ABC%';
     ```

8. **Not using appropriate data types:**
   - Mistake: Storing dates as strings.
   - Optimized: Use DATE data type for `order_date`:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, order_date DATE);
     ```

9. **Using GROUP BY with non-aggregate columns:**
   - Mistake: `SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;`
   - Optimized: Include all non-aggregate columns in the GROUP BY clause:
     ```sql
     SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
     ```

10. **Using ORDER BY with unnecessary columns:**
    - Mistake: `SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY product_name, unit_price;`
    - Optimized: Only include necessary columns in the ORDER BY clause:
      ```sql
      SELECT product_name, unit_price FROM products ORDER BY unit_price;
      ```

11. **Using OR in WHERE clause inefficiently:**
    - Mistake: `WHERE category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Clothing';`
    - Optimized: Rewrite query to use UNION ALL:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics'
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Clothing';
      ```

12. **Not handling NULL values properly:**
    - Mistake: Not considering NULL values.
    - Optimized: Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to handle NULL values:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
      ```
